    <h1>Privacy Policy for Truck Loads App</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 8, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Truck Loads App ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application (the "App").
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your privacy is our top priority. Our application is designed to be a completely offline, private tool. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal or business data to our servers or any third party. All data you enter remains exclusively on your device.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect and Store (Locally on Your Device)</h2>
    <p>
        The App requires you to enter certain information to function correctly. This information is stored only within the App's private, secure database on your local device. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Load Information:</strong> Details about your freight loads, including shipper/consignee names and addresses, load numbers, and freight rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Expense Information:</strong> Details about your expenses, including amounts, categories, dates, and optional descriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>User Profile Information:</strong> Your name, contact information, and company details that you provide for invoicing purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Photographs:</strong> If you use the camera feature, photos of receipts are stored in the App's private data directory on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Security PIN:</strong> If you enable the security feature, your PIN is stored using your device's native secure storage (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain). We do not have access to this PIN.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        The information stored by the App is used solely for the following purposes, all of which occur locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To display your loads, expenses, and dashboard KPIs.</li>
        <li>To generate PDF invoices and settlement reports.</li>
        <li>To perform calculations for your financial summaries.</li>
        <li>To allow you to back up and restore your data via the JSON import/export feature, which you control entirely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The App may request the following permissions to enable its features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> This permission is required to allow you to take photos of receipts and attach them to your expenses. The photos are stored only on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share any of your data. The App includes features that allow **you** to explicitly share your data (e.g., "Export to PDF", "Share PDF", "Export JSON"). This action is initiated entirely by you, and you have full control over where the data is sent.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
